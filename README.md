# LWE-Simple-C
 simple demonstration of a learning with errors-based cryptosystem. these programs serve as a starting point for incorporating into the seL4 architecture.
 
 - util.c contains foundational functions for generating random lattices, secret keys, public keys, and encryption.

 - encryption.c incorporates the basic LWE encryption function using the public key.

 - main.c demonstrates key generation and encryption of a single bit message.
